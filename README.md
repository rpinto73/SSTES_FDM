# SSTES_FDM
Finite difference model of the sand storage at the Urbandale Centre for Home Energy Research

To use the code, download the three script files and create a directory structure where your root directory has a folder called "Exp_Data_for_Models" and another for the script files. The experimental data that will be used as inputs to the FDM will be put into Exp_Data_for_Models, and can be downloaded from the Harvard Dataverse at this DOI: https://doi.org/10.
